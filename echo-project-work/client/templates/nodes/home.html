			Description
		</h2>
			<p>
				The Echo Project is developed by a team of senior engineers at Oklahoma State University that use portable weather stations to send an array of sensor data to this website for anyone to use. These stations were made to withstand torrential weather and wind speeds up to 200 mph. The idea behind this project is for a team to own multiple stations to deploy in front of a predicted storm path in any arrangement they would prefer. This way the team will gather data from many points along the path of the storm.
			</p>
		<h2 class="sub-header">
			Purpose
		</h2>
			<p>
				Each station will have several sensors and a GPS reading device to send GPS coordinates to the website so that anyone who wishes can view the collected data. Interested public individuals can view the data from any station and the data being transmitted can be downloaded. This allows anyone to run numbers on storm data to produce great storm models using this data.
			</p>
		<h2 class="sub-header">
			Outlook
		</h2>
			<p>
				In the future a team could set up a defensive grid for a city before an incoming storm arrives. City residence could then watch the closest station to them. Many technologies could tie into this grid if this project goes into full production. Grid apps along with alerts to proximity to station warnings. Maybe even the National Weather Service receiving live data from these stations.
