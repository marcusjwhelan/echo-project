Files in /public are served to the client as-is. 
Use this to store assets such as images. For example, 
if you have an image located at /public/background.png, 
you can include it in your HTML with 
<img src='/background.png'/> or in your CSS with 
background-image:url(/background.png). 
Note that /public is not part of the image URL.
